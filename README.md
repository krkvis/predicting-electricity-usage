# predicting-electricity-usage

This folder contains scripts for predicting electricity usage of commercial sites, one and 24 hours ahead.
Code was written by me (Kjersti Rustad Kvisberg) during the work on my master thesis "Prediction of electricity usage in Oslo Lufthavn Gardermoen" the autumn of 2022.

Other scripts were used to download data from online sources, format and merge data sets and visualize both input data sets and results from predictions. 
Please contact the author if you wish to access these additional scripts.
