# predicting-electricity-usage

This folder contains scripts for predicting electricity usage of commercial sites.
The method is based on recursive neural networks of the type Long Short-Term Memory, implemented using Keras.
There are two scripts for prediction electricity usage respectively one and 24 hours ahead.
Code was written during the work on my (Kjersti Rustad Kvisberg) master thesis "Prediction of electricity usage in Oslo Lufthavn Gardermoen" the autumn of 2022.

As part of the research project "Network balancing from large parking facilities and commercial buildings", the scripts were applied on a case study of Oslo Airport Gardermoen.
Electricity usage of the airport was estimated using meteorological data, in addition to calendar information and passenger numbers in the airport terminals.
More about the project and the thesis project can be found at the [project pages](https://www.nmbu.no/forside/prosjekter/nex2g).

Other scripts were used to download data from online sources, format and merge data sets and visualize both input data sets and results from predictions. 
Please contact the author if you wish to access these additional scripts.
